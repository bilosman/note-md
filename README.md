## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Go**: To run the server locally.
- Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bilosman/notes-md.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd notes-md
    ```

3. **Run the Go server**:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```

## Future Features

1. **Custom Themes**: Allow users to select different color themes (e.g., Dark Mode, Solarized).
2. **Export to PDF/HTML**: Support exporting the document as PDF or HTML files.
3. **Markdown Syntax Highlighting**: Implement live syntax highlighting.
4. **Auto-Save**: Persist Markdown text between sessions using `localStorage`.

7. **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Improve responsiveness for mobile devices.

## Future Plans for Go

In the future, **Go** will play a central role in the backend of the application, including:

1. **Server-side Markdown Rendering**: Offload Markdown parsing to the Go server for better performance, especially for larger documents.
2. **Database Integration**: Use Go to connect to a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for saving, retrieving, and managing Markdown documents.
3. **API Development**: Build an API for users to interact with their Markdown files programmatically, allowing collaboration and versioning.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Add user authentication and role-based access using Go for secure editing and file management.
